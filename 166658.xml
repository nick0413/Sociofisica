    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In the complement cascade, a panel of soluble molecules rapidly and effectively senses a danger or damage and triggers reactions to provide a response that discriminates among foreign intruders, cellular debris, healthy and altered host cells (Ricklin D et al. 2010). Complement proteins circulate in the blood stream in functionally inactive states. When triggered the complement cascade generates enzymatically active molecules (such as C3/C5 convertases) and biological effectors: opsonins (C3b, C3d and C4b), anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), and C5b, which initiates assembly of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC). Three branches lead to complement activation: the classical, lectin and alternative pathways (Kang YH et al. 2009; Ricklin D et al. 2010). The classical pathway is initiated by C1 complex binding to immune complexes, pentraxins or other targets such as apoptotic cells leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 components and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The lectin pathway is activated by binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) to repetitive carbohydrate residues, or by binding of ficolins to carbohydrate or acetylated groups on target surfaces. MBL and ficolins interact with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The alternative pathway is spontaneously activated by the hydrolysis of the internal thioester group of C3 to give C3(H2O). Alternative pathway activation involves interaction of C3(H2O) and/or previously generated C3b with factor B, which is cleaved by factor D to generate the alternative C3 convertases C3(H2O)Bb and/or C3bBb. All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form opsonin C3b and anaphylatoxin C3a. C3b covalently binds to glycoproteins scattered across the target cell surface. This is followed by an amplification reaction that generates additional C3 convertases and deposits more C3b at the local site. C3b can also bind to C3 convertases switching them to C5 convertases, which mediate C5 cleavage leading to MAC formation. Thus, the activation of the complement system leads to several important outcomes:  opsonization of target cells to enhance phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (MAC) assembly on the cell surface, production of anaphylatoxins C3a/C5a involved in the host inflammatory response, C5a-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis, and clearance of antibody-antigen complexes. The complement system is able to distinguish between pathological and physiological challenges, i.e. the outcomes of complement activation are predetermined by the trigger and are tightly tuned by a combination of initiation events with several regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms use soluble (e.g., C4BP, CFI and CFH) and membrane-bound regulators (e.g., CR1, CD46(MCP), CD55(DAF) and CD59) and are coordinated by complement receptors such as CR1, CR2, etc. In response to microbial infection complement activation results in flagging microorganisms with opsonins for facilitated phagocytosis, formation of MAC on cells such as Gram-negative bacteria leading to cell lysis, and release of C3a and C5a to stimulate downstream immune responses and to attract leukocytes. Most pathogens can be eliminated by these complement-mediated host responses, though some pathogenic microorganisms have developed ways of avoiding complement recognition or blocking host complement attack resulting in greater virulence (Lambris JD et al. 2008; Serruto D et al. 2010). All three complement pathways (classical, lectin and alternative) have been implicated in clearance of dying cells (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001; Gullstrand B et al.2009; Kemper C et al. 2008). Altered surfaces of apoptotic cells are recognized by complement proteins leading to opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis. In contrast to pathogens, apoptotic cells are believed to induce only a limited complement activation by allowing opsonization of altered surfaces but restricting the terminal pathway of MAC formation (Gershov D et al. 2000; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M 2011). Thus, opsonization facilitates clearance of dying cells and cell debris without triggering danger signals and further inflammatory responses (Fraser DA et al. 2007, 2009; Benoit ME et al. 2012). C1q-mediated complement activation by apoptotic cells has been shown in a variety of human cells: keratinocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cells, lung adenocarcinoma cells (Korb LC and Ahearn JM 1997; Mold C and Morris CA 2001; Navratil JS et al. 2001; Nauta AJ et al. 2004). In addition to C1q the opsonization of apoptotic Jurkat T cells with MBL also facilitated clearance of these cells by both dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Nauta AJ et al. 2004). Also C3b, iC3b and C4b deposition on apoptotic cells as a consequence of activation of the complement cascade may promote complement-mediated phagocytosis. C1q, MBL and cleavage fragments of C3/C4 can bind to several receptors expressed on macrophages (e.g. cC1qR (calreticulin), CR1, CR3, CR4) suggesting a potential clearance mechanism through this interaction (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001). Apoptosis is also associated with an altered expression of complement regulators on the surface of apoptotic cells. CD46 (MCP) bound to the plasma membrane of a healthy cell protects it from complement-mediated attack by preventing deposition of C3b and C4b, and reduced expression of CD46 on dying cells may lead to enhanced opsonization (Elward K et al. 2005). Upregulation of CD55 (DAF) and CD59 on apoptotic cell surfaces may protect damaged cells against complement mediated lysis (Pedersen ED et al. 2007; Iborra A et al. 2003; Hensel F et al. 2001). In addition, fluid-phase complement regulators such as C4BP, CFH may also inhibit lysis of apoptotic cells by limiting complement activation (Trouw LA et al 2007; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M. 2011). Complement facilitates the clearance of immune complexes (IC) from the circulation (Chevalier J and Kazatchkine MD 1989; Nielsen CH et al. 1997). Erythrocytes bear clusters of complement receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35), which serves as an immune adherence receptor for C3 and/or C4 fragments deposited on IC that are shuttled to liver and spleen, where IC are transferred and processed by tissue macrophages through an Fc receptor-mediated process. Complement proteins are always present in the blood and a small percentage spontaneously activate. Inappropriate activation leads to host cell damage, so on healthy human cells any complement activation or amplification is strictly regulated by surface-bound regulators that accelerate decay of the convertases (CR1, CD55), act as a cofactor for the factor I (CFI)-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b (CR1, CD46), or prevent the formation of MAC (CD59). Soluble regulators such as C4BP, CFH and FHL1 recognize self surface pattern-like glycosaminoglycans and further impair activation. Complement components interact with other biological systems. Upon microbial infection complement acts in cooperation with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to amplify innate host defense. Anaphylatoxin C5a binds C5a receptor (C5aR) resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the TLR and C5aR-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response to infection. This interplay is negatively modulated by co-ligation of TLR and the second C5a receptor, C5L2, suggesting the existence of complex immunomodulatory interactions (Kohl J 2006; Hajishengallis G and Lambris JD 2010). In addition to C5aR and C5L2, complement receptor 3 (CR3) facilitates TLR2 or TLR4 signaling pathways by promoting a recruitment of their sorting adaptor TIRAP (MAL) to the receptor complex (van Bruggen R et al. 2007; Kagan JC and Medzhitov R 2006). Complement may activate platelets or facilitate biochemical and morphological changes in the endothelium potentiating coagulation and contributing to homeostasis in response to injury (Oikonomopoulou K et al. 2012). The interplay of complement and coagulation also involves cleavage of C3 and C5 convertases by coagulation proteases, generating biologically active anaphylatoxins (Amara U et al. 2010). Complement is believed to link the innate response to both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Toapanta FR and Ross TM 2006; Mongini PK et al. 1997). The majority of published data is based on experiments using mouse as a model organism. Further characterization of the influence of complement on B or T cell activation is required for the human system, since differences between murine models and the human system are not yet fully determined. Complement is also involved in regulation of mobilization and homing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to the circulation and peripheral tissue in order to accommodate blood cell replenishment (Reca R et al. 2006). Thus, the complement system orchestrates the host defense by sensing a danger signal and transmitting it into specific cellular responses while extensively communicating with associated biological pathways ranging from immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development. Originally the larger fragment of Complement Factor 2 (C2) was designated C2a. However, complement scientists decided that the smaller of all C fragments should be designated with an 'a', the larger with a 'b', changing the nomenclature for C2. Recent literature may use the updated nomenclature and refer to the larger C2 fragment as C2b, and refer to the classical C3 convertase as C4bC2b. Throughout this pathway Reactome adheres to the original convention to agree with the current (Sep 2013) Uniprot names for C2 fragments. The complement cascade pathway is organised into the following sections: initial triggering, activation of C3 and C5, terminal pathway and regulation.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Complement activation is due to a cascade of proteolytic steps, performed by serine protease domains in some of the components. Three different pathways of activation are distinguished triggered by target-bound antibody (the classical pathway); microbial polysaccharide structures (the lectin pathway); or recognition of other "foreign" surface structures (the alternative pathway) by C3b. All three merge in the pivotal activation of C3 and, subsequently, of C5 by highly specific enzymatic complexes, the so-called C3/C5 convertases. A complement system with three C3 activation pathways and a common lytic pathway is found only in jawed vertebrates.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Two pathways lead to a complex capable of activating C4 and C2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The classical pathway is triggered by activation of the C1-complex, which consists of hexameric molecule C1q and a tetramer comprising two C1r and two C1s serine proteinases. This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens, a single IgM can initiate the pathway while multiple IgGs are needed, or when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Binding leads to conformational changes in C1q, activating the serine protease activity of C1r, which then cleaves C1s, another serine protease. The C1r:C1s component is now capable of splitting C4 and C2 to produce the classical C3-convertase C4b2a. C1r and C1s are additionally controlled by C1-inhibitor.(Kerr MA 1980)&lt;br&gt;The lectin pathway is similar in operation but has different components. &lt;p&gt;Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins (L-ficolin, M-ficolin and H-ficolin) initiate the lectin pathway cascade by binding to specific carbohydrate patterns on pathogenic cell surfaces. MBL and ficolins circulate in plasma in complexes with homodimers of MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) (Fujita et al. 2004; Hajela et al. 2002). Upon binding of human lectin (MBL or ficolins) to the target surface the complex of lectin:MASP undergoes conformational changes, which results in the activation of MASPs by cleavage (Matsushita M et al. 2000; Fujita et al. 2004). Activated MASPs become capable of C4 and C2 cleavage, giving rise to the same C3 convertase C4b:C2a as the classical pathway.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Activation of the lectin pathway (LP) is initiated by Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), the hetero-complex CL-LK formed from COLEC11 (Collectin liver 1, CL-L1) and COLEC10 (Collectin kidney 1, CL-K1), and the ficolins (FCN1, FCN2, FCN3). All are Ca-dependent (C-type) lectins that initiate the complement cascade after binding to specific carbohydrate patterns on the target cell surface. All form trimers and larger oligomers (Jensen et al. 2005, Dommett et al. 2006, Garlatti et al. 2010). MBL and ficolins circulate in plasma as complexes with homodimers of MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) (Fujita et al. 2004, Hajela et al. 2002). MASP1, MASP2 and MASP3 have all been reported to mediate complement activation. Upon binding of human lectin to the target surface, the complex of lectin:MASP undergoes conformational changes that result in MASP cleavage and activation (Matsushita M et al. 2000, Fujita et al. 2004). Active MASP2 cleaves C4 to generate C4a and C4b. C4b binds to the target cell surface via its thioester bond, then binds circulating C2 (Law and Dodds 1997). Bound C2 is cleaved by MASP2 to yield the C3 convertase C4b:C2a. The active form of MASP1 was reported to cleave C2 in a manner similar to MASP2 (Matsushita et al. 2000, Chen &amp; Wallis 2004). MASP1 can cleave proenzyme MASP2, leading to complement activation (Heja et al. 2012). MASP1 can also cleave fibrinogen to yield fibrinopeptide B, and activates factor XIII. MASP1 may have a role in removal of 'dead C3', i.e. C3(H2O) (Hajela et al. 2002). In addition to MASP1 to 3, two alternatively-slpiced forms of MASP1 (MAp44) and MASP2 (sMAP) have been implicated in complement cascade signaling (Takahashi et al. 1999, Degn et al. 2010). The functions of MASP3, sMAP and MAp44 in the lectin pathway remain to be clarified.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ficolins are recognition molecules in the lectin pathway of complement activation. Three types of ficolin have been identified in humans: M-ficolin (ficolin-1, FCN1), L-ficolin (ficolin-2, FCN2) and H-ficolin (ficolin-3, FCN3). FCN2 and 3 circulate in blood plasma whereas FCN1 is locally secreted by immune response cells (Teh et al. 2000, Liu et al. 2005, Matsushita et al. 2002). Plasma ficolins circulate as complexes with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). Upon binding of ficolins to carbohydrates on the target cell surface, MASPs are activated and subsequently activate the complement cascade (Matsushita et al. 2002, Gout et al. 2009). Ficolins function as trimers and larger oligomers. Ficolin peptide sequences contain an amino-terminal cysteine-rich region, a collagen-like domain, a neck region and a carboxy-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. The fibrinogen-like domain binds to pathogen- or apoptotic cell-associated molecular patterns. Different ficolins have distinct recognition specificities (Endo et al. 2007, Thiel and Gadjeva 2009, Garlatti et al. 2010).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ficolin-1 (M-ficolin or FCN1) was shown to localize at the cell surface of circulating monocytes and granulocytes, despite lacking an obvious transmembrane domain, (Teh C et al. 2000; Honore C et al. 2010). Ficolin-1 has also been found in human plasma (Honore C et al. 2008; Wittenborn T et al. 2010; Kjaer TR et al. 2011). Monocytes and macrophages, but not immature dendritic cells were reported to secrete Ficolin-1 into the serum (Honore C et al. 2010). Moreover, early studies revealed its presence in secretory granules of peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes (Liu Y et al. 2005). Soluble Ficolin-1 was found to form a complex with MASP2,  while cell surface-bound Ficolin-1 did not associate with MASP (Honore C et al. 2010; Kjaer TR et al. 2011).&lt;p&gt;Ficolin-1 specifically recognizes sialic acid and can bind to acetylated compounds such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) (Garlatti V et al. 2007; Gout E et al. 2010; Kjaer TR et al. 2011).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Functions in the lectin pathway of complement, which performs a key role in innate immunity by recognizing pathogens through patterns of sugar moieties and neutralizing them. The lectin pathway is triggered upon binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins to sugar moieties which leads to activation of the associated proteases MASP1 and MASP2. Functions as an endopeptidase and may activate MASP2 or C2 or directly activate C3 the key component of complement reaction. Isoform 2 may have an inhibitory effect on the activation of the lectin pathway of complement or may cleave IGFBP5. Also plays a role in development (PubMed:21258343).ACTIVITY REGULATION Inhibited by SERPING1 and A2M.SUBUNIT Homodimer. Interacts with the oligomeric lectins MBL2, FCN2 and FCN3; triggers the lectin pathway of complement through activation of C3. Interacts with SERPING1.

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Extracellular lectin functioning as a pattern-recognition receptor in innate immunity. Binds the sugar moieties of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) displayed on microbes and activates the lectin pathway of the complement system. May also activate monocytes through a G protein-coupled receptor, FFAR2, inducing the secretion of interleukin-8/IL-8 (PubMed:21037097). Binds preferentially to 9-O-acetylated 2-6-linked sialic acid derivatives and to various glycans containing sialic acid engaged in a 2-3 linkage.SUBUNIT Homotrimer (PubMed:17897951). Interacts with elastin/ELN. Interacts (via Fibrinogen C-terminal domain) with FFAR2. Interacts with CRP; may regulate monocyte activation by FCN1.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Peripheral blood leukocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. Also detected in spleen, lung, and thymus, may be due to the presence of tissue macrophages or trapped blood in these tissues. Not detected on lymphocytes.DOMAIN The fibrinogen C-terminal domain mediates calcium-dependent binding to carbohydrates and tethering to the cell surface in monocytes and granulocytes. The domain undergoes a conformational switch at pH under 6.2, and looses its carbohydrate-binding ability.SIMILARITY Belongs to the ficolin lectin family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ficolin-3 (H-ficolin, FCN3, Hakata antigen) consists of a collagen-like strand and three C-terminal recognition domains, which bind to carbohydrates on the target surface. Circulating FCN3 is associated with mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASP). Upon ligand binding the FCN3:MASP complex triggers activation of the lectin pathway (Matsushita et al. 2002, Teillet et al. 2008, Zacho et al. 2012). FCN3 can specifically recognize Aerococcus viridans (Tsujimura et al. 2002, Zacho et al. 2012) and binds patterns of bacterial polysaccharides such as d-fucose and galactose (Garlatti et al. 2007). In adition to pathogenic ligands, FCN3 was reported to bind apoptotic Jurkat cells (Kuraya et al. 2005).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION May function in innate immunity through activation of the lectin complement pathway. Calcium-dependent and GlcNAc-binding lectin. Has affinity with GalNAc, GlcNAc, D-fucose, as mono/oligosaccharide and lipopolysaccharides from S.typhimurium and S.minnesota.SUBUNIT Homotrimer (PubMed:17215869). May form an octadecamer consisting of an elementary trimer unit. Does not interact with fibronectin, elastin or zymosan. Interacts with MASP1 and MASP2.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Liver and lung. In liver it is produced by bile duct epithelial cells and hepatocytes. In lung it is produced by both ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells.PTM The N-terminus is blocked.SIMILARITY Belongs to the ficolin lectin family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The MBL polypeptide chain consists of a short N-terminal cysteine-rich region, a collagen-like region comprising 19 Gly-X-Y  triplets, a 34-residue hydrophobic stretch, and a C-terminal C-type lectin domain. MBL monomers associate via their cysteine-rich and collagen-like regions to form homotrimers, and these in turn associate into oligomers. The predominant oligomers found in human serum contain three (MBL-I) or four (MBL-II) homotrimers (Fujita et al. 2004, Teillet et al. 2005). Extracellular MBL oligomers circulate as complexes with MASP1/2. In the presence of Ca2+, the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of MBL binds carbohydrates with 3- and 4- OH groups in the pyranose ring, such as mannose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Such motifs occur on the surfaces of viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The affinity of any one MBL binding site for a carbohydrate ligand is low, but interaction between multiple binding sites on an MBL oligomer and repetitive carbohydrate motifs on a target cell surface allow high-avidity binding. The specificity of the MBL binding site (it does not bind glucose or sialic acid) and the requirement for a repeated target motif may account for the failure of MBL to bind human glycoproteins under normal conditions (Petersen et al. 2001). This reaction in particular represents the interaction of MBL with bacterial mannose repeats.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Calcium-dependent lectin involved in innate immune defense (PubMed:35102342). Binds mannose, fucose and N-acetylglucosamine on different microorganisms and activates the lectin complement pathway. Binds to late apoptotic cells, as well as to apoptotic blebs and to necrotic cells, but not to early apoptotic cells, facilitating their uptake by macrophages. May bind DNA. Upon SARS coronavirus-2/SARS-CoV-2 infection, activates the complement lectin pathway which leads to the inhibition SARS-CoV-2 infection and a reduction of the induced inflammatory response (PubMed:35102342).SUBUNIT Oligomeric complex of 3 or more homotrimers. Interacts with MASP1 and MASP2. Interacts with MEP1A and MEP1B and may inhibit their catalytic activity. Interacts with CR1 (via Sushi 24 and Sushi 25 domains).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with SARS coronavirus-2/SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein homotrimer; the interaction is calcium-dependent and modulated by Spike glycoprotein glycosylation state.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Plasma protein produced mainly in the liver.DOMAIN The coiled-coil domain mediates trimerization.POLYMORPHISM Genetic variations in MBL2 influence susceptibility to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [MIM:610424].POLYMORPHISM Genetic variations in MBL2 may influence susceptibility to severe COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.POLYMORPHISM Genetic variations in MBL2 are responsible for mannose-binding protein deficiency [MIM:614372]. This condition is defined as MBL2 protein level of less than 100 ng/ml, is present in about 5% of people of European descent and in about 10% of sub-Saharan Africans. Most MBL2-deficient adults appear healthy, but low levels of MBL2 are associated with increased risk of infection in toddlers, in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and in organ-transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs, particularly recipients of liver transplants. There is an association between low levels of MBL2 and a defect of opsonization which results in susceptibility to frequent and chronic infections (PubMed:1675710). Functional MBL2 deficiency may be associated with protection against tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium africanum but not by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as observed in studies on Ghanaian patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PubMed:21695215).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1, CL-11, COLEC11) (Keshi et al. 2006) forms disulfide-bridged stable heteromers with collectin liver 1 (CL-L1, COLEC10) (Otahani et al. 1999), with a ratio of one COLEC10 to two COLEC11 polypeptide chains. The majority of plasma COLEC11 was found in complex with COLEC10 (Henriksen et al. 2013). The resulting COLEC10:2xCOLEC11 heterocomplex, termred CL-LK, contains multiple Ca2+ -dependent carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) and collagen-like regions, which allow high-avidity binding (KD ~10-9 M) to target cell surface carbohydrate patterns (Bajic et al. 2015); COLEC11 recognizes L-fucose and D-mannose and the disaccharide D-mannose(alpha1-2)-D-mannose (Keshi et al. 2006, Hansen et al. 2010, Selman &amp; Hansen 2012, ).  CL-LK can bind mannose-rich patterns on M. tuberculosis (Troegeler et al. 2015). The CL-LK complex was able to bind mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs) in vitro with affinities in the nM range, and was associated with MASP1/3 and MASP2 in plasma. Upon binding to mannan or DNA in the presence of MASP2, the COLEC10:COLEC11 complex mediated deposition of C4b (Henriksen et al. 2013).    Polymorphisms in the COLEC11 gene cause 3MC syndrome (Rooryck et al. 2011).</bp:comment>

Calcium-dependent lectin that binds self and non-self glycoproteins presenting high mannose oligosaccharides with at least one terminal alpha-1,2-linked mannose epitope (PubMed:25912189). Primarily recognizes the terminal disaccharide of the glycan (PubMed:25912189). Also recognizes a subset of fucosylated glycans and lipopolysaccharides (PubMed:17179669, PubMed:25912189). Plays a role in innate immunity through its ability to bind non-self sugars presented by microorganisms and to activate the complement through the recruitment of MAPS1 (PubMed:20956340, PubMed:25912189). Also plays a role in apoptosis through its ability to bind in a calcium-independent manner the DNA present at the surface of apoptotic cells and to activate the complement in response to this binding (Probable). Finally, plays a role in development, probably serving as a guidance cue during the migration of neural crest cells and other cell types during embryogenesis (PubMed:21258343, PubMed:28301481).SUBUNIT Homotrimer; disulfide-linked (PubMed:20956340, PubMed:25912189). Interacts with MASP1; probably triggers the lectin pathway of complement (PubMed:20956340).TISSUE SPECIFICITY Ubiquitous (PubMed:17179669).

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">MBL or ficolins binding to carbohydrates on the target surface results in conformational changes in the lectin:MASPs complex. It in turn promotes a cleavage of proenzyme form of MASP between the CCP2 and the serine protease domains, which results in the generation of the active form. The active form of MASP-2 is able to cleave C4 and C2 to generate the C3 convertase (Vorup-Jensen T et al. 2000; Chen CB and Wallis R 2004). The active form of MASP-1 was shown to facilitate the complement activation by either direct cleavage of complex-bound MASP-2 or cleavage of C2 bound to C4 (Matsushita M et al. 2000; Heja D et al. 2012).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C1, the first component of complement is a complex containing three protein species, C1q, C1r, and C1s. C1q is assembled from six identical subunits each of which consists of three homologous chains (A, B, and C). These chains form a globular domain at the C-terminus, followed by the "neck" and a coil in the "stalk." The six subunits are held together by the collagenous stalk parts (giving rise to the comparison of C1q with a "bunch of six tulips"). The stalks also interact with the [C1s:C1r:C1r:C1s] tetramer assembled in a linear chain. Binding of an antigen to an antibody of the IgM or IgG class induces a conformational change in the Fc domain of the antibody that allows it to bind to the C1q component of C1. C1 activation requires interaction with two separate Fc domains, so pentavalent IgM antibody is far more efficient at complement activation than IgG antibody. Antibody binding results in a conformational change in the C1r component of the C1 complex and a proteolytic cleavage of C1r, activating it. Active C1r then cleaves and activates the C1s component of the C1 complex (Muller-Eberhard 1988).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C1 activation requires interaction with two separate Fc domains, so pentavalent IgM antibody is far more efficient at complement activation than IgG antibody (Muller-Eberhard and Kunkel 1961). Antibody binding results in a conformational change in the C1r component of the C1 complex and a proteolytic cleavage of C1r, activating it (Ziccardi and Cooper 1976). This reaction is irreversible under physiological conditions.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V segment of the variable domain of immunoglobulins light chain that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGKV4-1*01.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin light chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of the functional IMGT allele IGKV2-29*02 that is not represented on the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38). The sequence of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) is that of IMGT allele IGKV2-29*01 that is a pseudogene due to a stop codon polymorphism at position 113.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7.</bp:comment>

Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGKV1-16*02.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin light chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGKV2D-40*01.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin light chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGKV3D-20*01.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Constant region of immunoglobulin light chains. Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGLC3*03.MISCELLANEOUS Alleles IGLC3*01, IGLC3*02, and IGLC3*03 display the following serological isotype: Mcg-, Kern- and Oz+. The Mcg-isotype marker is characterized by Ala-6, Ser-8 and Thr-57; the Ke- marker by Ser-46 and the Oz+ marker by Lys-83. Allele IGLC3*04 displays the following serological isotype: Mcg-, Kern- and Oz-. The Mcg- isotype marker is characterized by Ala-6, Ser-8 and Thr-57; the Ke- marker by Ser-46 and the Oz- marker by Arg-83.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin light chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGLV7-43*01.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8.</bp:comment>

The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles.

Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGLV3-19*01.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin heavy chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGHV3-23*04.CAUTION For examples of full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains (of different isotypes) see AC P0DOX2, AC P0DOX3, AC P0DOX4, AC P0DOX5 and AC P0DOX6.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin heavy chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGHV2-5*02.CAUTION For examples of full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains (of different isotypes) see AC P0DOX2, AC P0DOX3, AC P0DOX4, AC P0DOX5 and AC P0DOX6.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin heavy chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGHV3-30*18.CAUTION For examples of full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains (of different isotypes) see AC P0DOX2, AC P0DOX3, AC P0DOX4, AC P0DOX5 and AC P0DOX6.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin heavy chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGHV4-34*01.CAUTION For examples of full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains (of different isotypes) see AC P0DOX2, AC P0DOX3, AC P0DOX4, AC P0DOX5 and AC P0DOX6.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Constant region of immunoglobulin heavy chains. Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268).SUBUNIT Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked.POLYMORPHISM There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGHG4*04.CAUTION For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin gamma heavy chain see AC P0DOX5.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION C1q associates with the proenzymes C1r and C1s to yield C1, the first component of the serum complement system. The collagen-like regions of C1q interact with the Ca(2+)-dependent C1r(2)C1s(2) proenzyme complex, and efficient activation of C1 takes place on interaction of the globular heads of C1q with the Fc regions of IgG or IgM antibody present in immune complexes.SUBUNIT C1 is a calcium-dependent trimolecular complex of C1q, R and S in the molar ration of 1:2:2. C1q subcomponent is composed of nine subunits, six of which are disulfide-linked dimers of the A and B chains, and three of which are disulfide-linked dimers of the C chain. Interacts (via C-terminus) with CD33; this interaction activates CD33 inhibitory motifs (PubMed:28325905). Interacts with CR1 (via Sushi 24 and Sushi 25 domains) (PubMed:29563915, PubMed:9324355).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Staphylococcus aureus protein Cna; this interaction results in the inhibition of the classical complement pathway.PTM O-linked glycans are assumed to be the Glc-Gal disaccharides typically found as secondary modifications of hydroxylated lysines in collagen-like domains.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Displays several functions associated with host defense: it promotes agglutination, bacterial capsular swelling, phagocytosis and complement fixation through its calcium-dependent binding to phosphorylcholine. Can interact with DNA and histones and may scavenge nuclear material released from damaged circulating cells.SUBUNIT Homopentamer. Pentraxin (or pentaxin) have a discoid arrangement of 5 non-covalently bound subunits. Interacts with FCN1; may regulate monocyte activation by FCN1.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Found in plasma.INDUCTION The concentration of CRP in plasma increases greatly during acute phase response to tissue injury, infection or other inflammatory stimuli. It is induced by IL1/interleukin-1 and IL6/interleukin-6.MISCELLANEOUS This protein owes its name to its ability precipitate pneumococcal C-polysaccharide in the presence of calcium.SIMILARITY Belongs to the pentraxin family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The alpha chain of C4 is cleaved, releasing an N-terminal portion of this chain as C4a. The beta and gamma chains are not cleaved and remain linked to the alpha chain by disulfide bonds (Nagasawa et al. 1976, 1980). The resulting C4b heterotrimer undergoes a gross conformational change; the internal thioester in C4b becomes exposed and able to form covalent bonds with surrounding molecules (Law and Dodds 1997). A large proportion of the bonds formed are with water, but some will attach C4b to biological surfaces (Rother et al. 1998). This irreversible reaction can be catalyzed by activated MBL, generated through the lectin pathway of complement activation (Fujita et al. 2004; Hajela et al. 2002), and by activated C1, generated through the classical pathway (Muller-Eberhard and Lepow 1965).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;N.B. Humans have two highly polymorphic loci for Complement factor 4, C4A and C4B. C4A alleles carry the Rodgers (Rg) blood group antigens while the C4B alleles carry the Chido (Ch) blood group antigens. The two loci encode non identical C4 peptides; C4 derived from C4A reacts more rapidly with the amino groups of peptide antigens while C4B allotypes react more rapidly with the hydroxyl group of carbohydrate antigens. The names of the two loci are always represented in uppercase. C4a and C4b refer to the peptide products of Complement Factor 4 cleavage.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Non-enzymatic component of C3 and C5 convertases and thus essential for the propagation of the classical complement pathway. Covalently binds to immunoglobulins and immune complexes and enhances the solubilization of immune aggregates and the clearance of IC through CR1 on erythrocytes. C4A isotype is responsible for effective binding to form amide bonds with immune aggregates or protein antigens, while C4B isotype catalyzes the transacylation of the thioester carbonyl group to form ester bonds with carbohydrate antigens.FUNCTION Derived from proteolytic degradation of complement C4, C4a anaphylatoxin is a mediator of local inflammatory process. It induces the contraction of smooth muscle, increases vascular permeability and causes histamine release from mast cells and basophilic leukocytes.SUBUNIT Circulates in blood as a disulfide-linked trimer of an alpha, beta and gamma chain.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Complement component C4 is expressed at highest levels in the liver, at moderate levels in the adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, thyroid gland, and the kidney, and at lowest levels in the heart, ovary, small intestine, thymus, pancreas and spleen. The extra-hepatic sites of expression may be important for the local protection and inflammatory response.PTM Prior to secretion, the single-chain precursor is enzymatically cleaved to yield non-identical chains alpha, beta and gamma. During activation, the alpha chain is cleaved by C1 into C4a and C4b, and C4b stays linked to the beta and gamma chains. Further degradation of C4b by C1 into the inactive fragments C4c and C4d blocks the generation of C3 convertase. The proteolytic cleavages often are incomplete so that many structural forms can be found in plasma.PTM N- and O-glycosylated. O-glycosylated with a core 1 or possibly core 8 glycan.POLYMORPHISM The complement component C4 is the most polymorphic protein of the complement system. It is the product of 2 closely linked and highly homologous genes, C4A and C4B. Once polymorphic variation is discounted, the 2 isotypes differ by only 4 amino acids at positions 1120-1125: PCPVLD for C4A and LSPVIH for C4B. The 2 isotypes bear several antigenic determinants defining Chido/Rodgers blood group system [MIM:614374]. Rodgers determinants are generally associated with C4A allotypes, and Chido with C4B. Variations at these loci involve not only nucleotide polymorphisms, but also gene number and gene size. Some individuals may lack either C4A, or C4B gene. Partial deficiency of C4A or C4B is the most commonly inherited immune deficiency known in humans with a combined frequency over 31% in the normal Caucasian population (PubMed:11367523). C4A6 allotype is deficient in hemolytic activity. Allotype C4A13 is infrequent. Common copy-number variants of C4A and C4B affecting expression of complement component C4 in the brain have been associated with schizophrenia risk (PubMed:26814963).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Non-enzymatic component of the C3 and C5 convertases and thus essential for the propagation of the classical complement pathway. Covalently binds to immunoglobulins and immune complexes and enhances the solubilization of immune aggregates and the clearance of IC through CR1 on erythrocytes. C4A isotype is responsible for effective binding to form amide bonds with immune aggregates or protein antigens, while C4B isotype catalyzes the transacylation of the thioester carbonyl group to form ester bonds with carbohydrate antigens.FUNCTION Derived from proteolytic degradation of complement C4, C4a anaphylatoxin is a mediator of local inflammatory process. It induces the contraction of smooth muscle, increases vascular permeability and causes histamine release from mast cells and basophilic leukocytes.SUBUNIT Circulates in blood as a disulfide-linked trimer of alpha, beta and gamma chains. C4b interacts with CR1 (via Sushi 1 and Sushi 2 domains).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Binds B.burgdorferi OspC, the interaction is inhibited by complement factor C2 (PubMed:28873507). This binding may inhibit the complement cascade and allow the bacteria to survive in the host bloodstream (Probable).TISSUE SPECIFICITY Complement component C4 is expressed at highest levels in the liver, at moderate levels in the adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, thyroid gland, and the kidney, and at lowest levels in the heart, ovary, small intestine, thymus, pancreas and spleen. The extra-hepatic sites of expression may be important for the local protection and inflammatory response.PTM Prior to secretion, the single-chain precursor is enzymatically cleaved to yield non-identical chains alpha, beta and gamma. During activation, the alpha chain is cleaved by C1 into C4a and C4b, and C4b stays linked to the beta and gamma chains. Further degradation of C4b by C1 into the inactive fragments C4c and C4d blocks the generation of C3 convertase. The proteolytic cleavages often are incomplete so that many structural forms can be found in plasma.POLYMORPHISM The complement component C4 is the most polymorphic protein of the complement system. It is the product of 2 closely linked and highly homologous genes, C4A and C4B. Once polymorphic variation is discounted, the 2 isotypes differ by only 4 amino acids at positions 1120-1125: PCPVLD for C4A and LSPVIH for C4B. The 2 isotypes bear several antigenic determinants defining Chido/Rodgers blood group system [MIM:614374]. Rodgers determinants are generally associated with C4A allotypes, and Chido with C4B. Variations at these loci involve not only nucleotide polymorphisms, but also gene number and gene size. The second copy of C4B gene present in some individuals has been called C4B_2 by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). Some individuals may lack either C4A, or C4B gene. Partial deficiency of C4A or C4B is the most commonly inherited immune deficiency known in humans with a combined frequency over 31% in the normal Caucasian population (PubMed:11367523). Common copy-number variants of C4A and C4B affecting expression of complement component C4 in the brain have been associated with schizophrenia risk (PubMed:26814963).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The cleavage of C4 into C4a and C4b releases an acyl group from the intrachain thioester bond, allowing C4b to bond covalently to any adjacent biological substrates (Dodds &amp; Law 1998). C4 is encoded at two loci, C4A and C4B. The C4b proteins derived from these genes are not identical and have different binding preferences (Law et al 1984, Sepp et al. 1993); C4A-derived C4b binds more efficiently than C4B-derived C4b to amino groups, while C4B-derived C4b is more effective than C4A in binding to hydroxyl groups. The site of C4b deposition is not clearly established (Møller-Kristensen et al. 2003) but generally accepted to be the activating cell membrane surface, though it may be the activating complex itself.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C2 is cleaved into the large C2a and the small C2b fragment. This irreversible, extracellular reaction can be catalyzed by activated MBL, generated through the lectin pathway of complement activation (Vorup-Jensen et al. 2000), and by activated C1, generated through the classical pathway (Nasagawa and Stroud 1977). N.B. Early literature refers to the larger fragment of C2 as C2a. However, complement scientists decided that the smaller of all C fragments should be designated with an 'a', the larger with a 'b', changing the nomenclature for C2. For this reason recent literature may refer to the larger C2 fragment as C2b, and the classical C3 convertase as C4bC2b. Throughout this pathway, Reactome uses the current (Feb 2012) Uniprot names which adhere to the original naming practice.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Component C2 which is part of the classical pathway of the complement system is cleaved by activated factor C1 into two fragments: C2b and C2a. C2a, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor C4b to generate the C3 or C5 convertase.SUBUNIT C2a interacts with Schistosoma haematobium TOR (via N-terminal extracellular domain). This results in inhibition of the classical and lectin pathway of complement activation, probably due to interference with binding of C2a to C4b such that C3 convertase cannot be formed. This infers resistance to complement-mediated cell lysis, allowing parasite survival and infection.DOMAIN The MIDAS-like motif in the VWFA domain binds divalent metal cations.MISCELLANEOUS C2 is a major histocompatibility complex class-III protein.SIMILARITY Belongs to the peptidase S1 family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The proteins participating in alternative pathway activation are C3 (and C3b), the factors B, D, and properdin. In the first place, alternative pathway activation is a positive feedback mechanism to increase C3b. When C3b binds covalently to sugars on a cell surface, it can become protected. Then Factor B binds to C3b. In the presence of Factor D, bound Factor B is cleaved to Ba and Bb. Bb contains the active site for a C3 convertase. Properdin then binds to C3bBb to stabilize the C3bBb convertase on cell surface leading to cleavage of C3. Finally, a C3bBb3b complex forms and this is a C5 convertase.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The thioester linkage between cysteine residue 1010 and glutamine residue 1013 in the alpha chain of Complement factor 3 (C3) can spontaneously hydrolyze, yielding so-called C3(H2O) (Tack et al. 1980; Pangburn &amp; Muller-Eberhard 1980; Pangburn et al. 1981). Thioester bond hydrolysis causes conformational rearrangements that give C3(H2O) the ability to bind Factor B. The spontaneous hydrolysis rate of C3 under physiological conditions and temperature is about l% per hour, thus the C3b-like properties of C3(H2O) provide a continuous low level initiation of the alternative pathway of complement activation (Pangburn &amp; Muller-Eberhard 1983). If not bound by Factor B, C3(H2O) binds Factor H and is inactivated by Factor I</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION C3 plays a central role in the activation of the complement system. Its processing by C3 convertase is the central reaction in both classical and alternative complement pathways. After activation C3b can bind covalently, via its reactive thioester, to cell surface carbohydrates or immune aggregates.FUNCTION Derived from proteolytic degradation of complement C3, C3a anaphylatoxin is a mediator of local inflammatory process. In chronic inflammation, acts as a chemoattractant for neutrophils (By similarity). It induces the contraction of smooth muscle, increases vascular permeability and causes histamine release from mast cells and basophilic leukocytes.SUBUNIT C3 precursor is first processed by the removal of 4 Arg residues, forming two chains, beta and alpha, linked by a disulfide bond. C3 convertase activates C3 by cleaving the alpha chain, releasing C3a anaphylatoxin and generating C3b (beta chain + alpha' chain). Forms the pro-C3-convertase enzyme complex by interacting with Complement factor B Bb fragment (Bb), which is then stabilized by binding CFP, allowing the complex to become active (PubMed:28264884, PubMed:31507604). The interaction with Bb is dependent on Mg2+ (PubMed:31507604). C3b interacts with CR1 (via Sushi 8 and Sushi 9 domains) (PubMed:8175757, PubMed:2972794). C3b interacts with CFH (PubMed:21285368). C3d interacts with CFH (PubMed:21285368, PubMed:21317894). C3dg interacts with CR2 (via the N-terminal Sushi domains 1 and 2). During pregnancy, C3dg exists as a complex (probably a 2:2:2 heterohexamer) with AGT and the proform of PRG2. Interacts with VSIG4. Interacts (both C3a and ASP) with C5AR2; the interaction occurs with higher affinity for ASP, enhancing the phosphorylation and activation of C5AR2, recruitment of ARRB2 to the cell surface and endocytosis of GRP77.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) C3b interacts with herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HHV-2) envelope glycoprotein C; this interaction inhibits the activation of the complement system.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Staphylococcus aureus immunoglobulin-binding protein Sbi; this interaction prevents the association between C3dg and CR2.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Staphylococcus aureus protein Fib.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Plasma. The acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is expressed in adipocytes and released into the plasma during both the fasting and postprandial periods.PTM C3b is rapidly split in two positions by factor I and a cofactor to form iC3b (inactivated C3b) and C3f which is released. Then iC3b is slowly cleaved (possibly by factor I) to form C3c (beta chain + alpha' chain fragment 1 + alpha' chain fragment 2), C3dg and C3f. Other proteases produce other fragments such as C3d or C3g. C3a is further processed by carboxypeptidases to release the C-terminal arginine residue generating the acylation stimulating protein (ASP). Levels of ASP are increased in adipocytes in the postprandial period and by insulin and dietary chylomicrons.PTM (Microbial infection) C3 is cleaved by Staphylococcus aureus aureolysin; this cleavage renders C3a and C3b inactive. C3b is rapidly degraded by host factors CFH and CFI preventing its deposition on the bacterial surface while C3a is further inactivated by aureolysin.PTM Phosphorylated by FAM20C in the extracellular medium.POLYMORPHISM There are two alleles: C3S (C3 slow), the most common allele in all races and C3F (C3 fast), relatively frequent in Caucasians, less common in Black Americans, extremely rare in Orientals.DISEASE Increased levels of C3 and its cleavage product ASP, are associated with obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease. Short-term endurance training reduces baseline ASP levels and subsequently fat storage.CAUTION An article reported the interaction surface between C3 and CR2 (PubMed:11387479). According to a another paper, it is however an artifact and can be ascribed to the presence of zinc acetate in the buffer (PubMed:21527715).CAUTION The difference between allele C3S (C3 slow) and allele C3F (C3 fast) was reported to be caused by a an Asn at position 1216 instead of an Asp (PubMed:2473125). The paper was however retracted (PubMed:2584723).</bp:comment>

The spontaneous hydrolysis rate of C3 under physiological conditions and temperature is about l% per hour, thus the C3b-like properties of C3(H2O) provide a continuous low level initiation of the alternative pathway of complement activation (Pangburn &amp; Muller-Eberhard 1983).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Factor B which is part of the alternate pathway of the complement system is cleaved by factor D into 2 fragments: Ba and Bb. Bb, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor 3b to generate the C3 or C5 convertase. It has also been implicated in proliferation and differentiation of preactivated B-lymphocytes, rapid spreading of peripheral blood monocytes, stimulation of lymphocyte blastogenesis and lysis of erythrocytes. Ba inhibits the proliferation of preactivated B-lymphocytes.SUBUNIT Monomer (PubMed:19574954). Part of the C3-convertase enzyme complex comprised of Complement C3 beta chain (C3b) and Complement factor B Bb fragment (Bb) and CFP (PubMed:28264884, PubMed:31507604). Interacts to C3b; this interaction is dependent on the presence of Mg2+ (PubMed:28264884, PubMed:31507604). Interacts to CFP; this interaction contributes to the stabilization of the active C3-convertase enzyme complex (PubMed:31507604).DOMAIN The unliganded VWA domain has an inactive 'locked' conformation whereby the scissile Arg-259|Lys-260 bond is protected from proteolytic activation.POLYMORPHISM Two major variants, F and S, and 2 minor variants, as well as at least 14 very rare variants, have been identified.SIMILARITY Belongs to the peptidase S1 family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C3(H2O):Factor Bb is a C3 convertase, sometimes referred to as the initial C3 convertase (iC3). The Factor Bb component catalyzes the hydrolysis of C3 to produce C3b and C3a. This reaction is not known to be directly coupled to the association of C3b complexes with a cell surface. It is believed that a small proportion of C3b spontaneously associates with the cell surface, otherwise it is rapidly inactivated (Muller-Eberhard 1988).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Metastable C3b can bind a wide variety of proteins and carbohydrates expressed on biological surfaces (Coico &amp; Sunshine, 2009; Kimball 2010). This is an essentially random event (Dodds &amp; Law, 1998); binding may be to host or microorganism. However, certain surface sugars have greater C3b binding rates, perhaps explaining variations in microorganism suceptibility (Pangburn, M.  in The Complement System, Ed. Rother et al. 1998).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C3b:Bb is naturally labile with a half-life of ~90 s; association of the complex with properdin extends the half-life to ~30 min. (Medicus et al. 1976). Properdin is found in the blood as a mixture of multivalent oligomers: 30% dimers, 45% trimers, 10% tetramers, and 15% higher oligomers. Monomers associate with one another in a head-to-tail arrangement, producing closed circular structures (Smith et al. 1984; Alcorlo M et al. 2013). These features suggest that the properdin oligomer associated with a C3b:Bb complex on a surface such as a cell membrane can facilitate recruitment of additional C3b:Bb complexes to the site (Farries et al. 1988; Hourcade 2006).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The 3 pathways of complement activation converge on the cleavage of C3  by C3 convertases. C3 convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b - a central  step of complement activation. C3a remains in the fluid phase and acts  as an anaphylatoxin, whereas C3b can form additional C3 convertases hastening the production of C3b. Besides, C3b binds to C3 convertases to form C5 convertase, which can act as an opsonin, or is degraded into fragments which  cannot form an active convertase.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C4b and C2a bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4bC2a), C3b and the Bb fragment of Factor B form the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb). The C3(H2O):Bb C3 convertase is sometimes called the initiating convertase, and the C5 convertases also have C3 convertase activity (Rawal &amp; Pangburn 2001).&lt;p&gt;All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form two fragments C3b and C3a. The cleavage of component C3 exposes a reactive thioester bond on C3b, leading to the covalent attachment of C3b to glycoproteins on the target cell surface (Law SK et al. 1979; Tack BF et al. 1980). The opsonization with C3b enables the recruitment of phagocytes (Newman SL et al. 1985; Gadjeva M et al. 1998). In addition, C3b anchors the assembly of C3/C5 convertases leading to an amplification of C3 cleavage and effecting C5 activation (Fearon DT 1979; Takata Y et al 1987; Kinoshita T et al. 1988). Moreover, the activation of C3b exposes binding sites for factors B, H and I, properdin, decay accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), complement receptor 1 (CR1) and microbial molecules such as vaccinia virus complement-control protein and staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) from Staphylococcus aureus (Forneris F et al. 2010; Morgan HP et al. 2011; Nilsson SC et al. 2010; Lambris JD et al. 1984; Medof ME et al.1984; Barilla-LaBarca ML et al. 2002; Smith BO et al. 2002; Bernet J et al. 2004; Garcia Bl et al. 2010) . C3b associates with these molecules to mediate the activation, amplification and regulation of the complement response.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C5 convertases are serine proteases that cleave C5 with high efficiency; the C3 convertases can cleave C5 but have a poor affinity for C5, with a Km of 6-9 microM. The high affinity C5 convertases are generated when the low affinity C3/C5 convertases such as C4b:C2a deposit C3b by cleaving native C3. These C3b-containing C3/C5 convertases have Km values of 0.005 microM, well below the normal concentration of C5 in blood (0.37 microM). They have very low Vmax rates, just one C5 cleaved per 1–4 min per enzyme (Rawal &amp; Pangburn 1998).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cleavage of C5 by C5 convertases is the last enzymatic step in the complement activation. C5 convertases are formed when C3b molecule is covalently deposited in the immediate vicinity of pre-assembled C3 convertases switching them to C5 convertases C4bC2aC3b and C3bBbC3b (Takata Y et al 1987; Kinoshita T et al. 1988; Rawal N and Pangburn MK 2001, 2003). The additional C3b acts like an anvil for C5; it interacts with C5 and presents C5 in the correct conformation for cleavage by the C2a or Bb enzyme. The proteolytic cleavage of C5 generates the small fragment C5a and the large fragment C5b.&lt;p&gt;C5b initiates an assembly of terminal complement components (C6-C9) leading to the formation of membrane attack complex (MAC) on the target surface (Aleshin AE et al. 2012; Hadders MA et al. 2012). MAC disrupts the cell membrane causing a subsequent cell death through osmotic lysis.&lt;p&gt; Anaphylatoxin C5a mediates pro-inflammatory and immunemodulatory signals via its receptors C5aR and C5L2. The anaphylatoxin receptors are found on surfaces of phagocytes as well as other cell types. In inflammation, they induce cytokine production, degranulation and chemotaxis of leukocytes (Monk PN et al. 2007).&lt;br&gt;</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Activation of C5 by a C5 convertase initiates the spontaneous assembly of the late complement components, C5-C9, into the membrane attack complex. C5b has a transient binding site for C6. The C5b-C6 complex is the foundation upon which the lytic complex is assembled.SUBUNIT C5 precursor is first processed by the removal of 4 basic residues, forming two chains, beta and alpha, linked by a disulfide bond. C5 convertase activates C5 by cleaving the alpha chain, releasing C5a anaphylatoxin and generating C5b (beta chain + alpha' chain). Interacts with the tick complement inhibitors OmCI, RaCI1 and CirpT1 (PubMed:18536718, PubMed:27018802, PubMed:31871188). Interacts with cobra venom factor (CVF) (PubMed:21217642).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Staphylococcus aureus protein SSL5.POLYMORPHISM C5 variants are responsible for poor response to eculizumab [MIM:615749]. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody highly effective in reducing intravascular hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. It specifically binds to the terminal complement protein C5, inhibits its cleavage into C5a and C5b, and prevents the formations of the cytolytic complement pore (PubMed:24521109).DISEASE An association study of C5 haplotypes and genotypes in individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus infection shows that individuals homozygous for the C5_1 haplotype have a significantly higher stage of liver fibrosis than individuals carrying at least 1 other allele.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Activation of the complement system significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous acute and chronic diseases. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize the human complement protein C5 have been shown to effectively block C5 cleavage, thereby preventing the generation of pro-inflammatory complement components (Thomas et al. 1996, review Horiuchi &amp; Tsukamoto 2016). The mAb eculizumab was the first therapeutic for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (Rother et al. 2007). Ravulizumab, also used to treat PNH, was engineered from eculizumab to have an inherently longer circulating half-life so as to extend dosing intervals (Sheridan et al. 2018). Tesidolumab is an investigational mAb targeting complement C5, inhibiting terminal complement activation. Zilucoplan is a small macrocyclic peptide that binds to C5 with high affinity and specificity. It is being investigated for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG), a rare autoimmune disease (Howard et al. 2020).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After cleavage of C5, C5b undergoes conformational changes and exposes a binding site for C6. C5b6 binds C7 resulting in the exposure of membrane binding sites and incorporation into target membranes. The membrane-bound C5b-7 complex can then bind C8. C5b-8 acts as a polymerizing agent for C9. The first C9 bound to C5b-8 undergoes major structural changes enabling formation of an elongated molecule and allows binding of additional C9 molecules and insertion of C9 cylinders into the target membrane. The number of C9 molecules varies from 1-12 in the membrane, although polymers containing up to fifteen C9 molecules are also possible.</bp:comment>

C9 is the pore-forming subunit of the MAC (PubMed:4055801, PubMed:26841934, PubMed:30111885).SUBUNIT Component of the membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC assembly is initiated by proteolytic cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b binds sequentially C6, C7, C8 and multiple copies of the pore-forming subunit C9 (PubMed:22832194). About 20 C9 chains oligomerize to give rise to a huge beta-barrel that forms a 100 Angstrom diameter pore in target membranes (PubMed:26841934, PubMed:30111885).TISSUE SPECIFICITY Plasma (at protein level).PTM Thrombin cleaves factor C9 to produce C9a and C9b.PTM Phosphorylation sites are present in the extracellular medium.PTM Initially, positions and connectivity of disulfide bonds were based on peptide sequencing done for the human protein (PubMed:8603752). The crystal structures for the human and mouse proteins corrected the positions and connectivities of the disulfide bonds (PubMed:30111885). The distance between Cys-57 and Cys-94 in the monomeric mouse protein precludes formation of a disulfide bond, contrary to what is seen in the structure of the human polymeric form of the protein (Probable).SIMILARITY Belongs to the complement C6/C7/C8/C9 family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">SUBUNIT Antiparallel disulfide-linked heterodimer of an alpha chain and a beta chain (PubMed:12047389, PubMed:1491011, PubMed:1551440, PubMed:2780565, PubMed:2387851, PubMed:8328966, PubMed:1974459). Self-associates and forms higher oligomers (PubMed:1903064). Interacts with a broad range of misfolded proteins, including APP, APOC2 and LYZ (PubMed:17407782, PubMed:8328966, PubMed:17412999). Slightly acidic pH promotes interaction with misfolded proteins (PubMed:12176985). Forms high-molecular weight oligomers upon interaction with misfolded proteins (PubMed:19535339). Interacts with APOA1, LRP2, CLUAP1 and PON1 (PubMed:15480429, PubMed:17260971, PubMed:1742316, PubMed:8292612, PubMed:1903064). Interacts with the complement complex (PubMed:2601725). Interacts (via alpha chain) with XRCC6 (By similarity). Interacts with SYVN1, COMMD1, BTRC, CUL1 and with ubiquitin and SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes (PubMed:17451556, PubMed:20068069). Interacts (via alpha chain) with BAX in stressed cells, where BAX undergoes a conformation change leading to association with the mitochondrial membrane (PubMed:16113678). Does not interact with BAX in unstressed cells (PubMed:16113678). Found in a complex with LTF, CLU, EPPIN and SEMG1 (PubMed:17567961). Interacts (immaturely glycosylated pre-secreted form) with HSPA5; this interaction promotes CLU stability and facilitates stress-induced CLU retrotranslocation from the secretory pathway to the mitochondria, thereby reducing stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity (PubMed:22689054). Interacts (isoform 4) with BCL2L1; this interaction releases and activates BAX and promotes cell death (PubMed:21567405). Interacts with TGFBR2 and ACVR1 (PubMed:8555189). Interacts (secreted form) with STMN3; this interaction may act as an important modulator during neuronal differentiation (By similarity). Interacts with VLDLR and LRP8 (PubMed:24381170).TISSUE SPECIFICITY Detected in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, milk, seminal plasma and colon mucosa. Detected in the germinal center of colon lymphoid nodules and in colon parasympathetic ganglia of the Auerbach plexus (at protein level). Ubiquitous. Detected in brain, testis, ovary, liver and pancreas, and at lower levels in kidney, heart, spleen and lung.INDUCTION Up-regulated in response to enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection (at protein level) (PubMed:16548883). Up-regulated by agents that induce apoptosis, both at mRNA and protein level (PubMed:17689225). Isoform 1 is up-regulated by androgen (PubMed:17148459). Isoform 2 is down-regulated by androgen (PubMed:17148459).PTM Proteolytically cleaved on its way through the secretory system, probably within the Golgi lumen (PubMed:2387851). Proteolytic cleavage is not necessary for its chaperone activity (PubMed:25402950). All non-secreted forms are not proteolytically cleaved (PubMed:24073260). Chaperone activity of uncleaved forms is dependent on a non-reducing envoronment (PubMed:25402950).PTM Polyubiquitinated, leading to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:17451556, PubMed:19137541). Under cellular stress, the intracellular level of cleaved form is reduced due to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:17451556).PTM Extensively glycosylated with sulfated N-linked carbohydrates (PubMed:17260971, PubMed:2387851). About 30% of the protein mass is comprised of complex N-linked carbohydrate (PubMed:2387851). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces changes in glycosylation status and increases level of hypoglycosylated forms (PubMed:22689054). Core carbohydrates are essential for chaperone activity (PubMed:25402950). Non-secreted forms are hypoglycosylated or unglycosylated (PubMed:24073260).SIMILARITY Belongs to the clusterin family.CAUTION Isoform 4 has been previously detected in cytosol and in the nuclei of apoptotic cells and promoted apoptosis following irradiation (PubMed:12551933). However the nuclear localization and apoptosis promotion has not been confirmed in other cell types (PubMed:24073260).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C7 recruitment of C7 results in a weak association of C5b:C6:C7 with the target cell membrane, through a poorly characterized molecular mechanism (Muller -Eberhard et al. 1986).

C5b and C6 remains loosely bound to C3b until C5b binds to C7 and induces it to undergo a hydrophilic-amphiphilic transition. Hydrophobic binding regions for phospholipid are thereby exposed, and the trimolecular complex is endowed with a metastable membrane binding site. Membranebound
C5b-7 inflicts no harm on a cell but marks it for further assault.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Recruitment of the C8 trimeric complex is mediated by the C8 beta chain (Monahan &amp; Sodetz 1981). Binding enables C8 to undergo necessary conformational rearrangements that allow the C8 alpha chain to penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (Stecket et al. 1983, Weiland et al. 2014), firmly anchoring the C5b:C6:C7:C8 complex to the target cell membrane. A functional membrane pore can be formed by the C5b:C6:C7:C8 complex (Boyle et al. 1976, Tegla et al. 2011). These pores are small and unstable but can cause cell lysis if present in sufficient number (Martin et al. 1987). They also increase cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and thereby stimulate signalling pathways (Koski et al. 1983, Niculescu &amp; Rus 2001).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The membrane attack complex (MAC) is the cytolytic end product of the complement cascade, composed of one C5:C6:C7:C8 complex and 12 to 15 C9 molecules (Podack et al. 1982, Biesecker et al. 1993). 12 C9 molecules are represented in this reaction. C9 peptides polymerize to form a ring-shaped transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell (Kondos et al. 2010). While formation of a pore is typically associated with necrotic cell death, there is evidence of membrane permeabilization from MACs containing one C9 molecule per C5b–8 complex (Sims et al. 1983).</bp:comment>

    <bp:xref rdf:resource="#UnificationXref1127" />
    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Two inherent features of complement activation make its regulation very important: &lt;br&gt;1. There is an inherent positive feedback loop because the product of C3 activation forms part of an enzyme that causes more C3 activation.&lt;br&gt;2. There is continuous low-level activation of the alternative pathway (see Spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 thioester).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complement cascade activation is regulated by a family of related proteins termed the regulators of complement activation (RCA). These are expressed on healthy host cells. Most pathogens do not express RCA proteins on their surface, but many have found ways to evade the complement system by stably binding the RCA that circulates in human plasma (Lambris et al. 2008); trapping RCA is by far the most widely employed strategy for avoiding the complement response. RCA recruitment is common in bacteria such as E. coli and streptococci (Kraiczy &amp; Wurzner 2006) and has also been described for viruses, fungi and  parasites. RCA deposition and the complement system also have an important role in tissue homeostasis, clearing dead cells and debris, and preventing damage from oxidative stress (Weismann et al. 2011).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RCA proteins control complement activation in two different ways; by promoting the irreversible dissociation (decay acceleration) of complement convertases and by acting as cofactors for Complement factor I (CFI)-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b.&lt;br&gt;Decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55), Complement factor H (FH), Membrane Cofactor Protein (MCP) and Complement receptor 1 (CR1) are composed of arrays of tandem globular domains termed CCPs (complement control protein repeats) or SCRs (short consensus repeats). CR1, MCP and FH are cofactors for the CFI-mediated cleavage of C3b, generating iC3b. CR1 and MCP are also cofactors for C4b cleavage.&lt;br&gt; C4BP is an additional cofactor for the CFI-mediated cleavage of C4b.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C3b:Bb is naturally labile with a half-life of ~90 s. unless bound to properdin on the cell surface  (Medicus et al. 1976). C4bC2a is also unstable, lasting at best a few minutes (Kerr et al. 1980). Decay is associated with the release of the Bb or C2a fragments respectively into the fluid phase. The liberated C3b/C4b is able to re-bind Bb/C2a if Factor B/C2 are present.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Glycoprotein that plays an essential role in maintaining a well-balanced immune response by modulating complement activation. Acts as a soluble inhibitor of complement, where its binding to self markers such as glycan structures prevents complement activation and amplification on cell surfaces (PubMed:21285368, PubMed:25402769). Accelerates the decay of the complement alternative pathway (AP) C3 convertase C3bBb, thus preventing local formation of more C3b, the central player of the complement amplification loop (PubMed:19503104, PubMed:26700768). As a cofactor of the serine protease factor I, CFH also regulates proteolytic degradation of already-deposited C3b (PubMed:18252712, PubMed:28671664). In addition, mediates several cellular responses through interaction with specific receptors. For example, interacts with CR3/ITGAM receptor and thereby mediates the adhesion of human neutrophils to different pathogens. In turn, these pathogens are phagocytosed and destroyed (PubMed:9558116, PubMed:20008295).SUBUNIT Homodimer (PubMed:18005991, PubMed:19505476). Forms also homooligomers (PubMed:19505476). Interacts with complement protein C3b; this interaction inhibits complement activation (PubMed:16601698, PubMed:19503104, PubMed:20378178, PubMed:21285368, PubMed:28671664). Interacts with complement protein C3d (PubMed:20378178, PubMed:21285368, PubMed:29190743). Interacts with CR3/ITGAM; this interaction mediates adhesion of neutrophils to pathogens leading to pathogen clearance (PubMed:9558116, PubMed:20008295). Interacts with complement factor I (PubMed:28671664).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with West nile virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1); this interaction leads to the degradation of C3.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with C.albicans GPD2; the interaction is direct and leads to the degradation of C3 which enables the pathogen to evade the host innate immune system.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Neisseria meningitidis protein fHbp.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein E/OspE; this interaction recruits complement regulator factor H onto the bacterial surface to evade complement-mediated cell lysis.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Streptococcus pneumoniae protein virulence factor choline-binding protein A/CbpAN; this interaction enables Streptococcus pneumoniae to evade surveillance by human complement system.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Staphylococcus aureus surface protein serine-aspartate repeat protein E/SdrE; this interaction sequesters CFH on the surface of S.aureus for complement evasion.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Staphylococcus aureus protein Sbi; this interaction inhibits the complement activation of the alternative pathway.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (at protein level) (PubMed:25136834). CFH is one of the most abundant complement components in blood where the liver is the major source of CFH protein in vivo. in addition, CFH is secreted by additional cell types including monocytes, fibroblasts, or endothelial cells (PubMed:6444659, PubMed:2968404, PubMed:2139673, PubMed:25136834).DOMAIN Sushi 1-3 domain represents the minimal unit capable of cofactor activity (PubMed:18252712). The property to discriminate self surfaces from non-self surfaces depends on the C-terminal region made of Sushis 19-20 (PubMed:21285368).PTM Sulfated on tyrosine residues.CAUTION According to a report, Asn-217 is not glycosylated (PubMed:17591618). Another study observed glycosylation at this position (PubMed:19139490).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Factor H (CFH) regulates the alternative pathway C3 convertase C3bBb and its C3b component both in plasma and at host cell surfaces. CFH binds to membrane-associated C3b, competing with Factor B and thereby preventing formation of the active C3 convertase C3bBb. In addition, it acts as a cofactor for the Factor I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C3b to iC3b.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Factor H (CFH) binds to C3bBb, leading to displacement of Bb. Complement factor H-related protein 3 (FHR3) has also been reported to bind C3Bb leading to inhibition of C3Bb C3 convertase activity (Fritsche et al. 2010). CFH also acts as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C3b to iC3b.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">CFHR dimers bind C3b, acting as competitive antagonists of Factor H (CFH) binding (de Jorge et al. 2013, Tortajada et al. 2013). CFHR1, CFHR2, and CFHR5 have a dimerization motif within their amino-terminal domains that enables formation of three homodimers (CFHR1:CFHR1, CFHR2:CFHR2, CFHR5:CFHR5) and three heterodimers (CFHR1:CFHR2, CFHR1:CFHR5, and CFHR2:CFHR5). Multiple binding interactions and avidity enable these dimers to out-compete CFH at physiologically relevant concentrations. CFHR2 homodimers bind C3b while allowing C3 convertase formation, but the CFHR2 bound convertases does not cleave C3 (Eberhardt et al. 2013). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CFHR3 and CFHR4 do not contain the dimerization motif seen in CFHR1, 2 and 5 but compete with factor H for binding to C3b (Hellwage et al. 1999, Fritsche et al. 2010). CFHR4 exists predominantly as a dimer in plasma (Hellwage et al. 1999).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the main function of CFH is down-regulation of C3 activation through the alternative pathway amplification loop, CFHR dimers interfere with the C3b inhibitory actions of CFH, a process termed deregulation (de Jorge et al. 2013, Tortajada et al. 2013).</bp:comment>

The dimerized forms have avidity for tissue-bound complement fragments and efficiently compete with the physiological complement inhibitor CFH.SUBUNIT Head-to-tail homodimer and heterodimer with CFHR1 or CFHR2. Binds C3b in vitro.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed by the liver and secreted in plasma.DISEASE Defects in CFHR5 have been found in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and may contribute to the disease. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a complex genetic disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure and absence of episodes of enterocolitis and diarrhea. In contrast to typical hemolytic uremic syndrome, atypical forms have a poorer prognosis, with higher death rates and frequent progression to end-stage renal disease. Susceptibility to the development of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome can be conferred by mutations in various components of or regulatory factors in the complement cascade system. Other genes may play a role in modifying the phenotype.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Trypsin-like serine protease that plays an essential role in regulating the immune response by controlling all complement pathways. Inhibits these pathways by cleaving three peptide bonds in the alpha-chain of C3b and two bonds in the alpha-chain of C4b thereby inactivating these proteins (PubMed:7360115, PubMed:17320177). Essential cofactors for these reactions include factor H and C4BP in the fluid phase and membrane cofactor protein/CD46 and CR1 on cell surfaces (PubMed:2141838, PubMed:9605165, PubMed:12055245). The presence of these cofactors on healthy cells allows degradation of deposited C3b by CFI in order to prevent undesired complement activation, while in apoptotic cells or microbes, the absence of such cofactors leads to C3b-mediated complement activation and subsequent opsonization (PubMed:28671664).SUBUNIT Heterodimer of a light and heavy chains; disulfide-linked. The fully processed and mature protein circulates as a zymogen, and is allosterically activated by substrate-induced remodeling of the active site (PubMed:21768352). Interacts with C3b (PubMed:9291131, PubMed:28671664). Interacts with complement factor H (PubMed:9291131, PubMed:28671664).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Staphylococcus aureus clumping factor A/ClfA; this interaction enhances cleavage of C3b into iC3b by CFI.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed in the liver by hepatocytes (PubMed:6327681). Also present in other cells such as monocytes, fibroblasts or keratinocytes (PubMed:6444659, PubMed:17320177).SIMILARITY Belongs to the peptidase S1 family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Following the displacement of Bb from C3bBb, Factor I (CFI) cleaves Factor H-bound C3b producing iC3b, which remains bound to the membrane. The majority of the C3b alpha chain is retained as two fragments which are tethered to the beta chain by disulphide bonds. iC3b is proteolytically inactive and cannot contribute to the complement cascade process, though it still contributes to opsonization.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Factor I (CFI) cleaves iC3b into two molecules, C3c, which is released into solution, and C3dg, which remains attached to the membrane. This cleavage requires Complement receptor type 1 (CR1), which serves a cofactor for CFI (Medof et al. 1982).

iC3b and C3dg can bind CR2 (CD21) to enhance B-cell immunity (Tuveson et al.1991, Sarrias et al. 2001).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Membrane immune adherence receptor that plays a critical role in the capture and clearance of complement-opsonized pathogens by erythrocytes and monocytes/macrophages (PubMed:2963069). Mediates the binding by these cells of particles and immune complexes that have activated complement to eliminate them from the circulation (PubMed:2963069). Acts also in the inhibition of spontaneous complement activation by impairing the formation and function of the alternative and classical pathway C3/C5 convertases, and by serving as a cofactor for the cleavage by factor I of C3b to iC3b, C3c and C3d,g, and of C4b to C4c and C4d (PubMed:2972794, PubMed:8175757). Also plays a role in immune regulation by contributing, upon ligand binding, to the generation of regulatory T cells from activated helper T cells (PubMed:25742728).FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for Epstein-Barr virus.SUBUNIT Interacts (via Sushi 1 and Sushi 2 domains) with complement factor C4b (PubMed:2972794, PubMed:8175757). Interacts (via Sushi 8 and Sushi 9 domains) with complement factor C3b (PubMed:2972794, PubMed:8175757). Interacts (via Sushi 24 and Sushi 25 domains) with MBL2 (PubMed:23460739, PubMed:29563915). Interacts with FCN2 (PubMed:2972794). Interacts (via Sushi 24 and Sushi 25 domains) with C1QA (PubMed:9324355, PubMed:29563915).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with Epstein-Barr virus gp350.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Present on erythrocytes, a subset of T cells, mature B cells, follicular dendritic cells, monocytes and granulocytes.POLYMORPHISM CR1 contains a system of antigens called the Knops blood group system. Polymorphisms within this system are involved in malarial rosetting, a process associated with cerebral malaria, the major cause of mortality in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Common Knops system antigens include McCoy (McC) and Sl(a)/Vil (Kn4, or Swain-Langley; Vil or Villien). Sl(a-) phenotype is more common in persons of African descent and may protect against fatal malaria.POLYMORPHISM Other polymorphic forms of CR1 contain 23, 37 or 44 Sushi (CCP/SCR) domains instead of the 30 Sushi (CCP/SCR) domains. The most frequent alleles are the F allotype (shown here) and the S allotype (37 repeat Sushi domains). The gene frequencies of the F allotype and S allotype are 0.87 and 0.11 in Caucasians, 0.82 and 0.11 in African Americans, 0.89 and 0.11 in Mexicans.POLYMORPHISM Genetic variations in CR1 resulting in CR1 deficiency are involved in protection against severe malaria [MIM:611162]. Parasitized red blood cells (RBCs) from children suffering from severe malaria often adhere to complement receptor 1 (CR1) on uninfected RBCs to form clumps of cells known as rosettes. CR1-deficient red blood cells show greatly reduced rosetting and CR1 deficiency occurs in healthy individuals from malaria-endemic regions.SIMILARITY Belongs to the receptors of complement activation (RCA) family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Complement receptor CR2 (CD21) is predominantly expressed on the surface of B-cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). It binds the C3 fragments C3dg, C3d, and with lower affinity, inactive C3b (iC3b) on the antigen surface, where it forms the B cell co-receptor complex with CD19 and CD81 (Matsumoto et al. 1993). Co-ligation of receptors due to C3dg opsonisation lowers the threshold for B cell activation by 1000 to 10,000 times (Dempsey et al. 1996, Mongini et al. 1997); the C3d:CR2 complex induces an increase of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the presence of C3d-opsonized antigen on the B cell surface (Cherukuri et al. 2001). C3 is required for the induction and maintenance of B-cell lineage memory cells in germinal centers (GCs), where B cells encounter antigen-antibody-C3 fragment complexes on the surface of FDCs (Klaus &amp; Humphrey 1986). C3d-opsonized antigen binds to CR2 on FDCs, which can present the antigen and induce effector and memory B cells (Fang et al. 1998).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complement fragments, iC3b and C3dg, are produced in vivo due to the actions of the complement serine protease, factor I.  This enzyme cleaves C3b in the presence of cofactors (factor H, MCP/CD46, complement receptor 1/CR1/CD35) to generate iC3b.  CR1 acts as a cofactor for further factor I-mediated cleavage to C3dg.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Structural component of specialized membrane microdomains known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TERMs), which act as platforms for receptor clustering and signaling. Essential for trafficking and compartmentalization of CD19 receptor on the surface of activated B cells (PubMed:20237408, PubMed:27881302, PubMed:16449649). Upon initial encounter with microbial pathogens, enables the assembly of CD19-CR2/CD21 and B cell receptor (BCR) complexes at signaling TERMs, lowering the threshold dose of antigen required to trigger B cell clonal expansion and antibody production (PubMed:15161911, PubMed:20237408). In T cells, facilitates the localization of CD247/CD3 zeta at antigen-induced synapses with B cells, providing for costimulation and polarization toward T helper type 2 phenotype (PubMed:22307619, PubMed:23858057, PubMed:8766544). Present in MHC class II compartments, may also play a role in antigen presentation (PubMed:8409388, PubMed:8766544). Can act both as positive and negative regulator of homotypic or heterotypic cell-cell fusion processes. Positively regulates sperm-egg fusion and may be involved in acrosome reaction (By similarity). In myoblasts, associates with CD9 and PTGFRN and inhibits myotube fusion during muscle regeneration (By similarity). In macrophages, associates with CD9 and beta-1 and beta-2 integrins, and prevents macrophage fusion into multinucleated giant cells specialized in ingesting complement-opsonized large particles (PubMed:12796480). Also prevents the fusion of mononuclear cell progenitors into osteoclasts in charge of bone resorption (By similarity). May regulate the compartmentalization of enzymatic activities. In T cells, defines the subcellular localization of dNTPase SAMHD1 and permits its degradation by the proteasome, thereby controlling intracellular dNTP levels (PubMed:28871089). Also involved in cell adhesion and motility. Positively regulates integrin-mediated adhesion of macrophages, particularly relevant for the inflammatory response in the lung (By similarity).FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes. Association with CLDN1 and the CLDN1-CD81 receptor complex is essential for HCV entry into host cell.FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Involved in SAMHD1-dependent restriction of HIV-1 replication. May support early replication of both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 viruses in T cells, likely via proteasome-dependent degradation of SAMHD1.FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Specifically required for Plasmodium falciparum infectivity of hepatocytes, controlling sporozoite entry into hepatocytes via the parasitophorous vacuole and subsequent parasite differentiation to exoerythrocytic forms.SUBUNIT Homodimer (PubMed:20375010). Part of a complex composed of CD19, CR2/CD21, CD81 and IFITM1/CD225 in the membrane of mature B cells. Interacts (via the second extracellular domain) with CD19; this interaction is initiated early during biosynthesis in the ER and enables trafficking of only properly folded CD19 (PubMed:16449649, PubMed:1383329). Part of a complex that includes MHC class II/HLA-DR molecules and IFITM1 (PubMed:8409388). Interacts with IFITM1 (PubMed:2398277, PubMed:26354436). Interacts with IFITM2 and IFITM3 (By similarity). Part of integrin-tetraspanin complex composed of CD9, CD81, beta-1 and beta-2 integrins in the membrane of monocyte/macrophages (PubMed:12796480). Interacts (via the second extracellular domain) with integrin ITGAV:ITGB3 (PubMed:27993971). Interacts with CD247/CD3 zeta, ICAM1 and CD9 at the immune synapse on T cell membrane (PubMed:23858057). Part of a GPCR-tetraspanin complex consisting at least of ADGRG1, CD81, possibly CD9, and GNA11 in which CD81 enhances the association of ADGRG1 with GNA11 (PubMed:15004227). Part of a complex composed of CD9, CD81, PTGFRN and IGSF8 (By similarity). Interacts directly with IGSF8 (PubMed:11504738). Interacts with CD53 and SCIMP (PubMed:21930792). Interacts with SAMHD1 (via its C-terminus) (PubMed:28871089). Interacts with glypican GPC3 and with the transcriptional repressor HHEX; binding to GPC3 decreases the availability of free CD81 for binding to HHEX, resulting in nuclear translocation of HHEX and transcriptional repression (By similarity). Interacts with CLDN1 (PubMed:20375010, PubMed:21516087). Interacts with CLDN6 and CLDN9 (PubMed:20375010).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Plays a critical role in HCV attachment and/or cell entry by interacting with HCV E1/E2 glycoproteins heterodimer.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed on B cells (at protein level) (PubMed:20237408). Expressed in hepatocytes (at protein level) (PubMed:12483205). Expressed in monocytes/macrophages (at protein level) (PubMed:12796480). Expressed on both naive and memory CD4-positive T cells (at protein level) (PubMed:22307619).DOMAIN Binds cholesterol in a cavity lined by the transmembrane spans.PTM Not glycosylated.PTM Likely constitutively palmitoylated at low levels. Protein palmitoylation is up-regulated upon coligation of BCR and CD9-C2R-CD81 complexes in lipid rafts.SIMILARITY Belongs to the tetraspanin (TM4SF) family.</bp:comment>

Decreases the threshold for activation of downstream signaling pathways and for triggering B-cell responses to antigens (PubMed:2463100, PubMed:1373518, PubMed:16672701). Activates signaling pathways that lead to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores (PubMed:9382888, PubMed:9317126, PubMed:12387743, PubMed:16672701). Is not required for early steps during B cell differentiation in the blood marrow (PubMed:9317126). Required for normal differentiation of B-1 cells (By similarity). Required for normal B cell differentiation and proliferation in response to antigen challenges (PubMed:2463100, PubMed:1373518). Required for normal levels of serum immunoglobulins, and for production of high-affinity antibodies in response to antigen challenge (PubMed:9317126, PubMed:12387743, PubMed:16672701).SUBUNIT Interacts with CR2/CD21 (PubMed:1702139). Part of a complex composed of CD19, CR2/CD21, CD81 and IFITM1/CD225 in the membrane of mature B-cells (PubMed:1383329). Interacts directly with CD81 (via the second extracellular domain); this interaction is initiated early during biosynthesis in the ER/pre-Golgi compartments and is essential for trafficking and compartmentalization of CD19 receptor on the cell surface of activated B cells (PubMed:16449649). Interacts with VAV (PubMed:10706702). Interacts with GRB2 and SOS when phosphorylated on Tyr-348 and/or Tyr-378. Interacts with PLCG2 when phosphorylated on Tyr-409 (PubMed:10706702). Interacts with LYN (PubMed:7687428). Interacts (when tyrosine phosphorylated) with the regulatory p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3R1 or PIK3R2) (PubMed:7684160).TISSUE SPECIFICITY Detected on marginal zone and germinal center B cells in lymph nodes (PubMed:2463100). Detected on blood B cells (at protein level) (PubMed:2463100, PubMed:16672701).PTM Phosphorylated on tyrosine following B-cell activation (PubMed:7684160, PubMed:7687539, PubMed:10706702, PubMed:12387743). Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by LYN (PubMed:7687428). Tyrosine residues are phosphorylated sequentially after activation of the B cell receptor. Phosphorylation of Tyr-531 is extremely rapid, followed by phosphorylation at Tyr-409. In contrast, phosphorylation of Tyr-500 appears more slowly and is more transient, returning rapidly to basal levels (By similarity).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Acts as a cofactor for complement factor I, a serine protease which protects autologous cells against complement-mediated injury by cleaving C3b and C4b deposited on host tissue. May be involved in the fusion of the spermatozoa with the oocyte during fertilization. Also acts as a costimulatory factor for T-cells which induces the differentiation of CD4+ into T-regulatory 1 cells. T-regulatory 1 cells suppress immune responses by secreting interleukin-10, and therefore are thought to prevent autoimmunity.FUNCTION (Microbial infection) A number of viral and bacterial pathogens seem to bind MCP in order to exploit its immune regulation property and directly induce an immunosuppressive phenotype in T-cells.FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for Adenovirus subgroup B2 and Ad3.FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for cultured Measles virus.FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for Herpesvirus 6/HHV-6.FUNCTION (Microbial infection) May act as a receptor for pathogenic bacteria Neisseria and Streptococcus pyogenes (PubMed:7708671, PubMed:9379894, PubMed:11260136, PubMed:11971006).SUBUNIT Interacts with C3b (PubMed:3260937, PubMed:1717583). Interacts with C4b (PubMed:1717583). Interacts with moesin/MSN (PubMed:7884872).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with measles virus H protein.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with human herpesvirus 6 GH protein (PubMed:12663806, PubMed:12724329).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with human adenovirus B/D fiber protein (PubMed:12915534, PubMed:14566335, PubMed:15047806, PubMed:15078926, PubMed:15919905, PubMed:16254377).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Binds to Streptococcus pyogenes M protein and to type IV pili from Neisseria (PubMed:7708671, PubMed:9379894, PubMed:11260136, PubMed:11971006).TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed by all cells except erythrocytes.DOMAIN Sushi domains 1 and 2 are required for interaction with human adenovirus B PIV/FIBER protein and with Measles virus H protein. Sushi domains 2 and 3 are required for Herpesvirus 6 binding. Sushi domain 3 is required for Neisseria binding. Sushi domains 3 and 4 are required for interaction with Streptococcus pyogenes M protein and are the most important for interaction with C3b and C4b.PTM N-glycosylated on Asn-83; Asn-114 and Asn-273 in most tissues, but probably less N-glycosylated in testis. N-glycosylation on Asn-114 and Asn-273 is required for cytoprotective function. N-glycosylation on Asn-114 is required for Measles virus binding. N-glycosylation on Asn-273 is required for Neisseria binding. N-glycosylation is not required for human adenovirus binding.PTM Extensively O-glycosylated in the Ser/Thr-rich domain. O-glycosylation is required for Neisseria binding but not for Measles virus or human adenovirus binding.PTM In epithelial cells, isoforms B/D/F/H/J/L/3 are phosphorylated by YES1 in response to infection by Neisseria gonorrhoeae; which promotes infectivity. In T-cells, these isoforms may be phosphorylated by LCK.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Factor I (CFI) cleaves the truncated alpha (a') chain of C4b between Arg-1336 and Asn-1337 and then again between Arg-956 and Thr-957, producing a 16 kDa fragment known as alpha4, derived from the C terminus of the a' chain, followed by a 27 kDa alpha3 fragment. The remaining alpha 2 (C4d) fragment stays covalently bound to the cell membrane while the complex of disulfide-linked alpha3, alpha4, beta chain and gamma chain are released (C4c) into the fluid phase (Fujita et al. 1978).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Decay-accelerating-factor (DAF, CD55) is a membrane- bound complement regulatory protein that inhibits autologous complement cascade activation. It is expressed on all cells that are in close contact with serum complement proteins, but also on cells outside the vascular space and on tumour cells.  DAF binds to C3bBb and C4bC2a on cell surfaces, accelerating their dissociation and thereby inhibiting the amplification of complement. DAF can bind C3b and Bb, and must bind both for efficient decay acceleration. Although it can bind the inactive proenzymes C3b and C4b, the regulatory function of DAF is believed to be inhibition of activated C3 convertase enzymes (Harris et al. 2007).</bp:comment>

Interaction of daf with cell-associated C4b and C3b polypeptides interferes with their ability to catalyze the conversion of C2 and factor B to enzymatically active C2a and Bb and thereby prevents the formation of C4b2a and C3bBb, the amplification convertases of the complement cascade (PubMed:7525274). Inhibits complement activation by destabilizing and preventing the formation of C3 and C5 convertases, which prevents complement damage (PubMed:28657829).FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for Coxsackievirus A21, coxsackieviruses B1, B3 and B5.FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for Human enterovirus 70 and D68 (Probable).FUNCTION (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for Human echoviruses 6, 7, 11, 12, 20 and 21.SUBUNIT Monomer (major form) and non-disulfide-linked, covalent homodimer (minor form). Interacts with ADGRE5 (PubMed:11297558).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with coxsackievirus A21, coxsackieviruses B1, B3 and B5 capsid proteins.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with human enterovirus 70 and D68 capsid proteins (Probable).SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts with human echoviruses 6, 7, 11, 12, 20 and 21 capsid proteins.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed on the plasma membranes of all cell types that are in intimate contact with plasma complement proteins. It is also found on the surfaces of epithelial cells lining extracellular compartments, and variants of the molecule are present in body fluids and in extracellular matrix.DOMAIN The first Sushi domain (SCR1) is not necessary for function. SCR2 and SCR4 provide the proper conformation for the active site on SCR3 (By similarity).PTM The Ser/Thr-rich domain is heavily O-glycosylated.POLYMORPHISM Responsible for the Cromer blood group system (CROM) [MIM:613793]. It consists of at least 8 high-incidence (Cr(a), Tc(a), Dr(a), Es(a), WES(b), UMC, IFC and GUTI) and three low-incidence (Tc(b), Tc(c) and WES(a)) antigens that reside on DAF. In the Cromer phenotypes Dr(a-) and Inab there is reduced or absent expression of DAF, respectively. In the case of the Dr(a-) phenotype, a single nucleotide substitution within exon 5 accounts for two changes: a simple amino acid substitution, Leu-199 that is the basis of the antigenic variation, and an alternative splicing event that underlies the decreased expression of DAF in this phenotype. The Inab phenotype is a very rare one in which the red blood cells lack all Cromer system antigens. The red blood cells of individuals with Inab phenotype have a deficiency of DAF, but these individuals are not known to have any associated hematologic or other abnormalities (PubMed:12675719).SIMILARITY Belongs to the receptors of complement activation (RCA) family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) is a widely distributed membrane protein. It accelerates the dissociation of C3bBb and C4C2a, thereby inhibiting the amplification of complement. DAF can bind C3b and Bb but must bind both for efficient decay acceleration. The regulatory function of DAF is believed to be inhibition of activated C3 convertase enzymes rather than binding of inactive proenzymes (Harris et al. 2007).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The most abundant form of C4b-binding protein (C4BP) consists of seven alpha-chains (70kDa) and one beta-chain (45kDa) all linked by disulphide bonds to form a native protein with a molecular weight of 570kDa (Hilarp et al. 1989). Each alpha chain can bind C4b; it is not known whether full occupancy is necessary for subsequent events. The beta chain binds and inactivates Protein S, a component of the coagulation system. C4BP down-regulates complement activity in several ways: It binds to C4b thus inhibiting the formation of the classical pathway C3 convertase C4bC2a; it acts as a decay accelerating factor for existing convertases, probably by promoting dissociation of C2a; it is a cofactor in Factor I mediated C4b proteolysis.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Potent inhibitor of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) action. Acts by binding to the C8 and/or C9 complements of the assembling MAC, thereby preventing incorporation of the multiple copies of C9 required for complete formation of the osmolytic pore. This inhibitor appears to be species-specific. Involved in signal transduction for T-cell activation complexed to a protein tyrosine kinase.FUNCTION The soluble form from urine retains its specific complement binding activity, but exhibits greatly reduced ability to inhibit MAC assembly on cell membranes.SUBUNIT Interacts with T-cell surface antigen CD2.PTM N- and O-glycosylated. The N-glycosylation mainly consists of a family of biantennary complex-type structures with and without lactosamine extensions and outer arm fucose residues. Also significant amounts of triantennary complexes (22%). Variable sialylation also present in the Asn-43 oligosaccharide. The predominant O-glycans are mono-sialylated forms of the disaccharide, Gal-beta-1,3GalNAc, and their sites of attachment are probably on Thr-76 and Thr-77. The GPI-anchor of soluble urinary CD59 has no inositol-associated phospholipid, but is composed of seven different GPI-anchor variants of one or more monosaccharide units. Major variants contain sialic acid, mannose and glucosamine. Sialic acid linked to an N-acetylhexosamine-galactose arm is present in two variants.PTM Glycated. Glycation is found in diabetic subjects, but only at minimal levels in nondiabetic subjects. Glycated CD59 lacks MAC-inhibitory function and confers to vascular complications of diabetes.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Vitronectin is a cell adhesion and spreading factor found in serum and tissues. Vitronectin interact with glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. Is recognized by certain members of the integrin family and serves as a cell-to-substrate adhesion molecule. Inhibitor of the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway.FUNCTION Somatomedin-B is a growth hormone-dependent serum factor with protease-inhibiting activity.SUBUNIT Exists in two forms: a single chain 75 kDa form (V75) and a clipped form composed of two chains (65 kDa and 10 kDa) (V65+V10) which are held together by a disulfide bond. Interacts with SERPINE1/PAI1, insulin and C1QBP.SUBUNIT (Microbial infection) Interacts (via hemopexin repeat 2) with P.falciparum (isolate CDC / Honduras) SERA5 P47 (via C-terminus); may form heterotetramers of two VTN and SERA5 P47 heterodimers; the interaction may protect merozoites from phagocytosis by host monocytes; VTN glycosylation appears to be dispensable for the interaction.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed in the retina pigment epithelium (at protein level) (PubMed:25136834). Expressed in plasma (at protein level) (PubMed:2448300). Expressed in serum (at protein level) (PubMed:29567995).DOMAIN The SMB domain mediates interaction with SERPINE1/PAI1. The heparin-binding domain mediates interaction with insulin.PTM Sulfated on tyrosine residues.PTM N- and O-glycosylated.PTM Phosphorylation on Thr-69 and Thr-76 favors cell adhesion and spreading.PTM It has been suggested that the active SMB domain may be permitted considerable disulfide bond heterogeneity or variability, thus two alternate disulfide patterns based on 3D structures are described with 1 disulfide bond conserved in both.PTM Phosphorylation sites are present in the extracellular medium.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The plasma protease C1 inhibitor (C1Inh, SERPING1) can bind the activated C1r and C1s proteases in the activated C1 complex, rendering them proteolytically inactive (Sim et al. 1979a) and leading to the disassembly of the C1 complex, releasing inactive C1r:C1Inh and C1s:C1Inh complexes (Arlaud et al. 1979, Sim et al. 1979b, Ziccardi &amp; Cooper 1979). C1Inh also inhibits and controls certain non-antibody-induced as well as spontaneous C1 activation. Thus C1Inh plays an important role in regulating nonspecific complement activation (Ziccardi et al. 1983). C1Inh is also a major physiological inhibitor of kallikrein (Ratnoff et al. 1969), coagulation factors XIa and XIIa (Forbes et al. 1970), and the enzymatically active fragments derived from factor XIIa (factor XIIf) (Schreiber et al. 1973).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Activation of the C1 complex is under control of the C1-inhibitor. It forms a proteolytically inactive stoichiometric complex with the C1r or C1s proteases. May play a potentially crucial role in regulating important physiological pathways including complement activation, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and the generation of kinins. Very efficient inhibitor of FXIIa. Inhibits chymotrypsin and kallikrein.SUBUNIT Binds to E.coli stcE which allows localization of SERPING1 to cell membranes thus protecting the bacteria against complement-mediated lysis. Interacts with MASP1.PTM Highly glycosylated (49%) with N- and O-glycosylation. O-glycosylated with core 1 or possibly core 8 glycans. N-glycan heterogeneity at Asn-25: Hex5HexNAc4 (minor), dHex1Hex5HexNAc4 (minor), Hex6HexNAc5 (major) and dHex1Hex6HexNAc5 (minor).PTM Can be proteolytically cleaved by E.coli stcE.POLYMORPHISM Chymotrypsin uses Ala-465 as its reactive site in normal plasma protease C1 inhibitor, and His-466 as its reactive site in the variant His-466.SIMILARITY Belongs to the serpin family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The plasma protease C1 inhibitor (C1Inh, SERPING1) forms proteolytically inactive stoichiometric covalent complexes with the C1r and C1s proteases (Sim et al. 1979a). This effectively disassembles the C1 complex, releasing inactive C1r:C1Inh and C1s:C1Inh complexes (Arlaud et al. 1979, Sim et al. 1979b, Ziccardi &amp; Cooper 1979). C1Inh also inhibits and controls certain non-antibody-induced as well as spontaneous C1 activation. Thus C1Inh plays an important role in regulating nonspecific complement activation (Ziccardi et al. 1983). C1Inh is also a major physiological inhibitor of kallikrein (Ratnoff et al. 1969), coagulation factors XIa and XIIa (Forbes et al. 1970), and the enzymatically active fragments derived from factor XIIa (factor XIIf) (Schreiber et al. 1973).</bp:comment>

C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin, causing the release of histamine from mast cells and also being an effective leukocyte attractant. The C5a receptor (complement component 5a receptor 1, C5AR1; Cluster of Differentiation 88, CD88) (Gerard NP and Gerard C, 1991) mediates the pro-inflammatory and chemotactic actions of C5a.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide anaphylatoxin C5a (PubMed:1847994, PubMed:8182049, PubMed:7622471, PubMed:9553099, PubMed:10636859, PubMed:15153520, PubMed:29300009). The ligand interacts with at least two sites on the receptor: a high-affinity site on the extracellular N-terminus, and a second site in the transmembrane region which activates downstream signaling events (PubMed:8182049, PubMed:7622471, PubMed:9553099). Receptor activation stimulates chemotaxis, granule enzyme release, intracellular calcium release and superoxide anion production (PubMed:10636859, PubMed:15153520).SUBUNIT Homodimer. May also form higher-order oligomers (PubMed:12835319). Interacts (when phosphorylated) with ARRB1 and ARRB2; the interaction is associated with internalization of C5aR (PubMed:12464600). Interacts (via N-terminal domain) with S.aureus chemotaxis inhibitory protein (CHIPS); the interaction blocks the receptor and may thus inhibit the immune response (PubMed:15153520, PubMed:15542591, PubMed:21706042).PTM Sulfation plays a critical role in the association of C5aR with C5a, but no significant role in the ability of the receptor to transduce a signal and mobilize calcium in response to a small a small peptide agonist (PubMed:11342590). Sulfation at Tyr-14 is important for CHIPS binding (PubMed:21706042).PTM Phosphorylated on serine residues in response to C5a binding, resulting in internalization of the receptor and short-term desensitization to the ligand. The key residues involved in this process are Ser-334 and Ser-338.SIMILARITY Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">C5AR2 (GPR77, C5L2) has been described as a receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptides anaphylatoxin C5a, C4a and C3a and even their des-arginated derivatives. Highest binding affinity was for C3a-desArg, also called Acylation Stimulating Protein (ASP), produced from C3a following arginine removal by carboxypeptidases. Binding of C3a and its derivatives has been disputed (Johswich et al. 2006) leading to suggestions that this receptor may be a C5a scavenger. It is weakly coupled to G(i)-mediated signaling pathways and believed to function primarily as a decoy receptor though it can interact with beta arrestin (Van Lith et al. 2009).</bp:comment>

Couples weakly to G(i)-mediated signaling pathways.SUBUNIT Interacts with C3 (the anaphylatoxin peptide C3a and the adipogenic hormone ASP); the interaction occurs with higher affinity for ASP, enhancing the phosphorylation and activation of GPR77, recruitment of ARRB2 to the cell surface and endocytosis of GRP77.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons and liver.SIMILARITY Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Clusterin is a dimer of two fragments of the same translation product, which are disulfide bonded by five cysteines on each peptide (Tobe et al. 1991). It is able to modulate the terminal complement cascade in vitro and prevent cellular lysis by the membrane attack complex (MAC), C5b-9. Clusterin forms complexes with C5b:C6:C7, or C5b:C6:C7:C8 or C5b:C6:C7:C8:C9, as the proteins assemble into the amphiphilic MAC. Clusterin binding renders the complexes soluble and lytically inactive (Jenne &amp; Tschopp 1989, Choi et al. 1989, Murphy et al. 1989, Tschopp et al. 1993).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Thrombin, coagulation factors XIa, Xa, IXa and plasmin (Amara et al. 2010) can cleave C3 and C5 to generate C3a and C5a. Neutrophil elastase (ELANE) can cleave C5 generating an active C5a-like fragment (Vogt 2000). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under normal conditions, thrombin cleavage of C5 may not be a physiologically significant reaction (Bagic et al. 2015) but the combined action of thrombin and convertases appears to enhance the efficiency of the lytic pathway (Krisinger et al. 2012). Clotting-induced production of thrombin leads to cleavage of C5 at the atypical site R947 in the CUB domain. C5a can be released from the atypical C5a fragment (termed C5aT) by conventional C5 convertases; the truncated C5b fragment, termed C5bT, can form a C5bT-9 membrane attack complex that has significantly increased lytic activity (Krisinger et al. 2012).</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Thrombin, which cleaves bonds after Arg and Lys, converts fibrinogen to fibrin and activates factors V, VII, VIII, XIII, and, in complex with thrombomodulin, protein C. Functions in blood homeostasis, inflammation and wound healing.ACTIVITY REGULATION Inhibited by SERPINA5.SUBUNIT Heterodimer (named alpha-thrombin) of a light and a heavy chain; disulfide-linked. Forms a heterodimer with SERPINA5. In plasma, interacts (via N-terminus) with alpha-1-microglobulin with molar ratio 1:2 and 1:1; this interaction does not prevent the activation of prothrombin to thrombin.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed by the liver and secreted in plasma.PTM The gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues, which bind calcium ions, result from the carboxylation of glutamyl residues by a microsomal enzyme, the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The modified residues are necessary for the calcium-dependent interaction with a negatively charged phospholipid surface, which is essential for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.PTM N-glycosylated. N-glycan heterogeneity at Asn-121: Hex3HexNAc3 (minor), Hex4HexNAc3 (minor) and Hex5HexNAc4 (major). At Asn-143: Hex4HexNAc3 (minor) and Hex5HexNAc4 (major).PHARMACEUTICAL The peptide TP508 also known as Chrysalin (Orthologic) could be used to accelerate repair of both soft and hard tissues.MISCELLANEOUS Prothrombin is activated on the surface of a phospholipid membrane that binds the amino end of prothrombin and factors Va and Xa in Ca-dependent interactions; factor Xa removes the activation peptide and cleaves the remaining part into light and heavy chains. The activation process starts slowly because factor V itself has to be activated by the initial, small amounts of thrombin.MISCELLANEOUS It is not known whether 1 or 2 smaller activation peptides, with additional cleavage after Arg-314, are released in natural blood clotting.MISCELLANEOUS Thrombin can itself cleave the N-terminal fragment (fragment 1) of the prothrombin, prior to its activation by factor Xa.MISCELLANEOUS The cleavage after Arg-198, observed in vitro, does not occur in plasma.SIMILARITY Belongs to the peptidase S1 family.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Carboxypeptidase N (CPN) is able to inactivate the complement anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a, and C5a (Bokisch &amp; Müller-Eberhard 1970), 74-77 amino acid peptides that are released during complement activation. They mediate smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation, release of histamine from mast cells, and chemotaxis of selective bone marrow derived myeloid cells. C3a and C5a mediate their activities by binding the C3a receptor (C3AR1) and C5a receptor (C5AR1), respectively. CPN regulates these anaphylatoxins by removing their carboxy-terminal arginines, which reduces their biological activities 10-100-fold (Ember et al. 1998). &lt;br&gt;Carboxypeptidase B2 (Plasma carboxypeptidase B, Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor, TAF1, CPB2) also can convert C3a and C5a to C3a-desArg and C5a-desArg (Campbell et al. 2002). C3a-desArg cannot bind C3AR1, and C5a-desArg has a 90% decrease in pro-inflammatory activity compared to C5a (Sayah et al. 2003).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CPN is a tetramer comprised of two heterodimers each consisting of a CPN1 and CPN2 subunit (Levin et al. 1982, Keil et al. 2007). The catalytic CPN1 subunit ranges in size from 48 kDa to 55 kDa. This reflects processing by trypsin or plasmin, which can remove a C-terminal segment to produce the 48 kDa form, and cleave at Arg218-Arg219 to produce two peptide chains held together in an active conformation by non-covalent bonds (Levin et al. 1982, Quagraine et al. 2005). This step increases the catalytic activity of CPN towards chromogenic substrates.</bp:comment>

    <bp:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">FUNCTION Cleaves C-terminal arginine or lysine residues from biologically active peptides such as kinins or anaphylatoxins in the circulation thereby regulating their activities. Down-regulates fibrinolysis by removing C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin that has already been partially degraded by plasmin.ACTIVITY REGULATION TAFI/CPB2 is unique among carboxypeptidases in that it spontaneously inactivates with a short half-life, a property that is crucial for its role in controlling blood clot lysis. The zymogen is stabilized by interactions with the activation peptide. Release of the activation peptide increases a dynamic flap mobility and in time this leads to conformational changes that disrupt the catalytic site and expose a cryptic thrombin-cleavage site present at Arg-324.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Plasma; synthesized in the liver.PTM N-glycosylated. N-glycan at Asn-108: Hex5HexNAc4.SIMILARITY Belongs to the peptidase M14 family.</bp:comment>
